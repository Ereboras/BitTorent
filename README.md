# Personal BitTorrent client

The goal of this project is to have a small bitorrent client entirely coded by myself that I can use on the rare occasion I download through this protocol. This is also an educational project to teach myself how a peer to peer protocol work on the inside.

## Usage

Download a file :
```bash
python main.py 'path/to/file.torrent'
```

Unit testing :
```bash
python -m unittest -v
```
